      Founded in 1926 by George Lewis "Tex" Rickard, the New York Rangers were part of the "Original Six" and quickly became a beloved fixture in the National Hockey League (NHL). They won their first Stanley Cup in 1928, followed by triumphs in 1933, and 1940 â€“ a period marked by the talents of players like Frank Boucher, Bill Cook, and Bryan Hextall.

      The latter part of the 20th century saw the Rangers' ups and downs, but the team always remained in the hearts of its fans. The 1990s brought a renaissance, highlighted by the 1994 Stanley Cup win, led by Captain Mark Messier, whose leadership and performance in Game 6 against the New Jersey Devils became legendary. The likes of Brian Leetch, Adam Graves, and Mike Richter were instrumental in this era's success.

      As the team moved into the new millennium, the Rangers continued to see strong performances from players such as Henrik Lundqvist, who is considered one of the greatest goaltenders in NHL history. The 2013-2014 season saw the Rangers reach the Stanley Cup Finals, a testament to the team's resilience and enduring legacy.
